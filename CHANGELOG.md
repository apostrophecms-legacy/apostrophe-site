# Changelog

You should really be using ApostropheCMS 2.x or newer, which has all the functionality of this module built in, and much better. This is a legacy module only.

## 0.6.0

Based on the experimental appy 0.6.0, this version will use the mongodb 2.x driver, which should resolve many Apostrophe 0.5.x compatibility issues with newer Node.js.

## 0.5.x series

Uses the mongodb 1.x driver, which may not work at all on latest Node.js.
