# THIS MODULE IS FOR 0.5.X ONLY, DEPRECATED FOR ALL NEW PROJECTS

You do not need this module for your new Apostrophe project and it will not work with it. See the [apostrophe documentation](http://apostrophecms.org) for more information about Apostrophe 2.x which has all of the capabilities of this module built right in.

# Apostrophe Site

The Apostrophe Site module provides most of the scaffolding for projects built with Apostrophe 0.5.x, an OLD version of the Apostrophe content management system. You do not want this for your new project.

## Installation

**Don't, you should only find this module in a legacy project you are maintaining. These are old instructions.**

It is easiest to start by cloning the [Apostrophe sandbox project](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox) and pushing it up to your own repository. But skipping that step is pretty easy too. Let's assume you're starting from scratch.

Apostrophe itself requires:

* [node](http://nodejs.org/), of course. You must have at least version `0.10`
* [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) **version 2.2 or better**, on your local machine (or point to another database server)
* imagemagick, to resize uploaded images (specifically the `convert` and `identify` command line tools)

Create a new git project, then run `npm install apostrophe-site` to install the module.

## Configuring Your Site

Here's an `app.js` that demonstrates most of the options. Most of this is optional, of course. `root`, `shortName`, `hostName`, `adminPassword` and `sessionSecret` are required, and you almost certainly will want to add a few modules. You shoudl also set `baseUrl` if the protocol for your site is not HTTP. Everything else is totally skippable.

```javascript

    var site = require('apostrophe-site')({
      // Allows apostrophe-sites to require stuff
      // on our behalf and also find our root folder
      root: module,

      // Used to name the local mongodb database,
      // if you don't pass a db option with more details
      shortName: 'mysite',

      // Hostname you plan to give your site
      hostName: 'mysite.com',

      // If we don't set this, we get http://mysite.com
      baseUrl: 'https://mysite.com',

      // Title of your site. Used as a prefix to page titles and feed titles by default
      title: 'My Site',

      // This defaults to true and delivers HTML, CSS and JS much faster via
      // gzip transfer encoding. But you can set it to false if you must
      compress: true,

      // Apostrophe sizes your images to several awesome sizes right out of the box,
      // but we're greedy and we want something bigger than full (1280)
      addImageSizes: [
        {
          name: 'max',
          width: 1600,
          height: 1280
        }
      ],

      // By default the media library shows everyone's media until the user decides to
      // change that with the "uploaded by" filter. Want the default to go the other way?
      // Set the "owner" option as shown commented out below

      mediaLibrary: {
        // owner: 'user'
      },

      // Normally anyone who can edit a page or article etc. might
      // introduce new tags. If this is set true, new tags can only
      // be introduced via the admin tag editor
      lockTags: false,

      // Set up email transport via nodemailer. By default sendmail is used because
      // it requires no configuration, but you may use any valid transport, see the
      // nodemailer module documentation.

      mailer: {
        transport: 'sendmail',
        transportOptions: {}
      },

      // You can always log in at /login as admin, with this password
      adminPassword: 'SOMETHING SECURE PLEASE',

      // If a visitor tries to access a secured page, give them
      // a chance to log in and then be redirected to that page
      secondChanceLogin: true,

      // Invoked after login if secondChanceLogin is not set or
      // did not result in a page the user was allowed to see
      redirectAfterLogin: function(req, callback) {
        if (req.user.permissions.admin) {
          return callback('/awesomepeople');
        } else {
          return callback('/coolpeople');
        }
      },

      // Run some middleware on ALL requests. This happens AFTER
      // basics are in place like sessions and users and i18n.
      // Middleware functions here may take an initial "site" argument

      // middleware simply by setting a "middleware" property on

      // If the generated CSS has more than 4,095 rules, split into
      // multiple imported CSS files to avoid a limitation of IE9 and below.

      // A simple way to alter the results of every call to apos.get, and thus
      // every page, snippet, blog post, etc. The retrieved documents will be
      // in results.pages. Be aware that this property does not always exist,
      // as apos.get is sometimes used just to fetch distinct tags or
      // other metadata.
      afterGet: function(req, results, callback) {

      }
    });

```

## Two-Step Configuration

If you prefer you can configure Apostrophe in two steps:

```javascript
var site = require('apostrophe-site')();
site.init({ ... same configuration as above ... });
```

This allows you to pass your site object to functions implemented in other files in order to create parts of your configuration:

```javascript
// in app.js

var site = require('apostrophe-site')();
site.init({
  // ... regular stuff ...
  pages: {
    load: require('./lib/loaders.js')(site)
  }
});

// in lib/loaders.js

module.exports = function(site) {
  return [
    function(req, callback) {
      site.apos.doSomethingInteresting(callback);
    }
  ]
};
```

## Adding Modules to the Admin Bar

Adding a module to the `modules` property above does most of the work, but you do need to add it to the admin bar when appropriate. For instance, you'll want the "blog" menu to be added at the top of the page when the blog module is installed.

In our sandbox site or a project cloned from it, you would do that in `outerLayout.html`. Just look for calls like this one:

    {{ aposBlogMenu({ edit: permissions.edit }) }}

Conversely, if you choose not to include a module but haven't removed it from the admin bar, don't be surprised when you get a template error.

## Overriding the Templates of a Module

First `npm install` and configure `apostrophe-blog`. Then create a `lib/modules/apostrophe-blog/views` folder in your project. Copy any templates you wish to customize from the npm module's views folder to `lib/modules/apostrophe-blog/views`.

Boom! Apostrophe will automatically look first at your "project level" module folder.

*This also works for `apostrophe-schemas` and `apostrophe-pages`, even though they are not configured by the `modules` property.* `lib/modules/apostrophe-schemas/views` may contain overrides for schema field templates, and `lib/modules/apostrophe-pages/views` may contain overrides for `newPageSettings.html` and friends.

## Overriding a Module With a New Name

You can override a module more than once, for instance to set up two things that are similar in spirit to a blog. Just create folders in `lib/modules`, with your `views` overrides, and configure them in `app.js` via the `modules` option as shown above. Then use the `extend` property to tell Apostrophe what module you're extending.

You'll want to set the `name` and `instance` options so the database can distinguish between your stories and regular blog posts:
```javascript
    stories: {
      extend: 'apostrophe-blog',
      name: 'stories',
      instance: 'story',
      addFields: [
        {
          name: 'storyteller',
          type: 'string'
        }
      ]
    }
```
Note that you will need to copy the `new`, `edit` and `manage` templates to your `views` folder and fix any references to `blog` and `blog-post` to refer to `stories` and `story`.

## Overriding the Schema of a Module: Adding Custom Properties

As seen above, you can add and alter the properties of blog posts and similar things via the `addFields` and `alterFields` options as described in the [apostrophe-snippets](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-snippets) documentation. Those options can go right in the configuration for your module in `app.js`.

## Overriding and Extending Methods of a Module

If you really need to change a module's behavior, for instance changing what the page loader function does or the way it fetches data from the database, you'll need to subclass it. But we've made subclassing much easier. Just create an `index.js` file in your `lib/modules/mymodulename` folder.

Here's a really simple subclass that changes the way the `index` method of the blog behaves so that a featured story is available to the `index.html` template as the `featured` variable in nunjucks:
```javascript
    module.exports = stories;

    function stories(options, callback) {
      return new stories.Stories(options, callback);
    }

    stories.Stories = function(options, callback) {
      var self = this;

      module.exports.Super.call(this, options, null);

      var superIndex = self.index;
      self.index = function(req, snippets, callback) {
        self.get(req, { tags: 'featured' }, { limit: 1 }, function(err, results) {
          if(err) {
            callback(err);
          }
          if(results.total > 0) {
            req.extras.featured = results.snippets[0];
          }
          superIndex(req, snippets, callback);
        });
      };

      // Must wait at least until next tick to invoke callback!
      if (callback) {
        process.nextTick(function() { return callback(null); });
      }

    };
```
Note the use of `module.exports.Super`. This automatically points to the base class constructor.

Confused? Just remember to follow this pattern and put your method overrides after the call to `module.exports.Super`.

## Tip: Subclassing Snippets is Often a Good Idea

If it doesn't smell like a blog post, you probably want to subclass snippets instead. The blog module simply subclasses snippets and adds the idea of a publication date.

## Modules Can Have Nothing To Do With Snippets

You can configure modules that have nothing at all to do with snippets, too. Our own RSS and Twitter modules, for instance.

To configure a module with `apostrophe-site`, all you have to do is make sure it looks like this:
```javascript
    module.exports = factory;

    function factory(options, callback) {
      return new Construct(options, callback);
    }

    function Construct(options, callback) {
      var self = this;
      // Add a bunch of methods to self here, then...

      // Invoke the callback. This must happen on next tick or later!
      return process.nextTick(function() {
        return callback(null);
      });
    }

    // Export the constructor so others can subclass
    factory.Construct = Construct;
```
In a nutshell: you must export a factory function, and it must have a constructor as its `Construct` property.

## Options Provided to Modules

In addition to the options you specify in `app.js`, all modules receive:

`apos`: the `apos` object, a singleton which provides core methods for content management. See the [apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) module documentation.

`pages`: the `pages` object, a singleton which provides methods for dealing with the page tree. See the [apostrophe-pages](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-pages) module documentation.

`schemas`: the `schemas` object, a singleton which provides methods for dealing with schemas. Most of the time you won't interact with this directly, but you might if you're writing a module that handles moderated submissions and the like. See the [apostrophe-schemas](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-schemas) module documentation.

`mailer`: a `nodemailer` transport object, ready to send email as needed. See the [nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/) documentation.

`site`: an object containing `title`, `shortName` and `hostName` properties, as configured in `app.js`.

`modules`: an array of objects with `web` and `fs` properties, specifying the web and filesystem paths to each folder in the chain of overrides, which is useful if you wish to allow project-level overrides via `lib/modules` of views provided by an npm module. You can take advantage of this easily if you use the `mixinModuleAssets` and `serveAssets` mixins; see `assets.js` in the apostrophe module for documentation.

## Accessing Other Modules

After all modules have been initialized, `apostrophe-site` calls the `setBridge` method on each module that has one. This method receives an object containing all of the modules as properties. The `people` module, for instance, uses the bridge to access the `groups` module. Note that this is not called until after all modules have invoked their initialization callback.

## Publishing Modules

You can write custom modules in `lib/modules` for your project-specific needs, or install them with npm. If you use `lib/modules`, your module's code must load from `lib/modules/mymodulename/index.js`.

## Limitations

Currently `extend` does not check `lib/modules`, so the module you are extending must be published in npm. Most of the time we extend modules like `apostrophe-blog` and `apostrophe-snippets` in simple project-specific ways, so this isn't much of a problem so far.

## Internationalization

Using i18n is simple you enable it by adding the following in your apostrophe-site configuration in app.js:

```javascript
i18n: {
    // setup some locales - other locales default to defaultLocale silently
    locales:['en', 'de'],

    // you may alter a site wide default locale (optional, defaults to 'en')
    defaultLocale: 'de',

    // sets a custom cookie name to parse locale settings from  - defaults to apos_language (optional)
    cookie: 'yourcookiename',

    // whether to write new locale information to disk automatically - defaults to true (you will want to shut it off in production)
    // updateFiles: false
}
```

After doing this, you can internationalise text in your own templates with:

    {{ __('A sample string') }}

The `__` local will take care of language detection and will spit out the appropriate string from the JSON files that will be located in the `locales` folder of your project by default. If you look in that folder, you'll see multiple JSON files with a two letter language abbreviation as a filename, for instance:

    en.json
    de.json

Those will contain all the necessary strings. By default, i18n will automatically put anything new it finds there. However, you can disable this behaviour by setting `updateFiles` to false.
